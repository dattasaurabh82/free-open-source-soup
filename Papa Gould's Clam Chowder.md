# Papa Gould's Clam Chowder
A legacy, proprietary soup algorithm that I am now releasing it to the world in the spirit of F/OSS (free and open source soup). Follows downeast maine convention. This is an extremely robust recipe which can handle a lot of load and modification. Just trust your taste. 

## initialize ingredients: 
- 5 lbs of white potatoes
- 2 Large Spanish onions
- 4 10 oz cans of baby clams
- 2 7oz cans minced clams
- 1/2 stick of butter
- 1 12oz can of evaporated milk
- pork belly (optional) 

## maine.soup
Brown pork belly in the bottom of an 8-10 quart pot  (optional, for taste). 

Peel onions. Cut them coarsely. Add w/ butter to the pot. Add 1 quart cold water. Let it simmer between 30-90 minutes while you peel and dice potatoes and cover the potatoes in cold water in a bowl. 

Open the clam cans and drain the water into the pan. Add the diced potatoes to this mixture, and let the mixture simmer 5-10 minutes until the potatoes soft. Then add the clams themselves. 

Let this mixture cool, and then add the evaporated milk (stir the mixture constantly for awhile to keep it from curdling). Add some salt and pepper while it's cooking, and keep stirring while the top is off, and keep top on when not serving to prevent souring. Serve piping hot with oyster crackers or croutons.
