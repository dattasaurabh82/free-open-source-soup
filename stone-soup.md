#Stone Soup

## ingredients:
- A large pot
- 6 quarts of water
- A fire or portable stove, preferably with a rack to rest the pot
- A medium-sized stone
- A large spoon, ladle, or stick (for stirring)
- A place with a decent amount of foot traffic.

## procedure
1. Set up a fire or stove in an area with lots of foot traffic
2. Fill the large pot with 6 quarts of water and the stone
3. Put the pot on the fire.
4. Close the lid.
5. Wait for someone to pass by.
6. Say, "I'm making a special soup, it is almost done, but I just need one more ingredient. Do you have any salt? I'll share it with you if you help me out."
7. Obviously the stranger will give you some salt, they'll get some delicious soup in return!
8. Take the salt and tell them the soup needs a few hours to finish cooking, so they should come back later.
9. Open the lid and put the salt in the pot.
10. Repeat steps 4-9 with a new person, replacing "salt" with the next-cheapest ingredient you can think of. 
11. When you cannot find anyone else to add anything to your soup, take out the stone, then serve and enjoy with your new friends.
